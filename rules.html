      <p> The game starts with an empty table that has 100 boxes. When the player
      clicks a cell, the number increases by one and is displayed in the box, but
      this only happens when the user follows the following rules:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>To move horizontally or vertically, you have to skip two boxes </li>
        <li>To move diagonally, you have to skip one box </li>
        <li>You cannot click on the same box twice </li>
      </ol>
      <p> The goal of the game is to complete the table so that all 100 numbers
        are accounted for. As the table fills up, it will become more challenging
        for the user to find open spaces to fill up.</p>
